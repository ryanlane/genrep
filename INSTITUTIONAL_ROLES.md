# Institutional Roles Matrix (v0.1 Draft)

A comparative outline of authorities, responsibilities, and intervention powers.

| Institution | Selection Basis | Core Mandate | Can Flag | Can Require Mitigation | Can Delay | Can Veto | Override Path |
|-------------|-----------------|--------------|----------|------------------------|----------|---------|---------------|
| Scientific Integrity Council (SIC) | Peer election | Evidence validation & briefs | ✅ Scientific Objection | ❌ (Advisory only) | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| Council of Generations (CoG) | Mixed experts + lottery | Long-horizon stewardship | ✅ Generational Advisory | ✅ (Mitigation precondition) | ✅ (Future risk delay) | ✅ Generational Veto | Supermajority + referendum |
| Rights Chamber (Citizen Jury) | Stratified random + trained | Rights scrutiny (RIA validation) | ✅ Rights Concern | ✅ (Mitigation requirement) | ✅ (Rights redesign) | ❌ (Escalates to CRC) | N/A |
| Constitutional Rights Court (CRC) | Mixed nomination + confirmation | Constitutional rights enforcement | ✅ Judicial Warning | ✅ (Remedial orders) | ✅ (Injunction) | ✅ (Strike down law) | Constitutional amendment only |
| Equal Protection Commission (EPC) | Independent appointments | Systemic discrimination audits | ✅ Equity Alert | ✅ (Compliance plan) | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| Data & Digital Rights Authority (DDRA) | Independent tech-reg appointments | Algorithmic fairness & data governance | ✅ Data Risk Flag | ✅ (Mandated fixes) | ✅ (Suspend system) | ❌ | Appeal to CRC |
| National Science & Foresight Institute | Merit appointment | Scenario modeling & futures research | ✅ Scenario Risk Note | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| Citizen Jury (general) | Stratified random | Deliberative recommendation | ✅ Process Concern | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |
| Executive Council | Elected slate | Policy execution & administration | ✅ Implementation Risk | ✅ (Operational adjustments) | Emergency-only (bounded) | ❌ | Assembly reversal |
| Ombudsperson for Rights | Independent | Individual complaints channel | ✅ Rights Intake Flag | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | N/A |

## Intervention Power Ladder (Conceptual)
Informational Flag → Advisory Objection → Mandatory Mitigation → Delay / Injunction → Veto / Nullification.

## Overlap Resolution Principles
1. Higher-tier rights claims supersede administrative mitigation conflicts.
2. Generational Veto review pauses implementation even if administrative approvals are satisfied.
3. Scientific Objection recurrence (≥3 cycles) auto-triggers mandatory Citizen–Scientist Panel.

## Conflict Scenarios (Examples)
- DDRA suspension vs. Executive urgency: CRC arbitration within 14 days.
- CoG Mitigation vs. Budget Constraints: Executive proposes phased adaptation; Assembly up/down vote.
- Rights Chamber mitigation rejected by proponents: Automatic escalation to CRC advisory review.

## Transparency Requirements (Baseline)
- All flags publicly timestamped.
- All mitigation orders include rationale, metrics, and compliance deadline.
- Annual cross-institution audit summary (meta-report) consolidating conflict statistics.
