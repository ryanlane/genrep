## Governance Principles for Parameter Adjustment
1. Changes documented with empirical justification (participation analytics, rights impacts, error rates).
2. No parameter shift may retroactively invalidate an in-progress proposal (non-retroactivity).
3. Public consultation required for moving outside suggested range bands.
4. Emergency deviations sunset automatically unless ratified within one review interval.
