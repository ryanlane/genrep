# Emergency Protocols Framework (v0.1 Draft)

Defines bounded, rights-respecting procedures for activating, exercising, and retiring temporary powers during crises.

## 1. Scope
Applies to national-level activation for: natural disasters, pandemics, systemic cyberattack, critical infrastructure failure, or existential security threats.

## 2. Activation Criteria
| Category | Trigger Example | Verification Body |
|----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Public Health | WHO-declared pandemic + domestic R₀ > threshold | Health Science Panel |
| Climate / Environmental | Multi-region catastrophic flood/fire | Environmental Panel |
| Cyber / Infrastructure | Core comms outage > X hrs | National Resilience Unit |
| Security / Existential | Coordinated attack or cascading infrastructure risk | Executive Council + independent verification |

Minimum: Dual attestation (Executive Council + relevant panel) + public declaration.

## 3. Emergency Powers Catalog
| Power | Scope | Limits | Oversight |
|-------|-------|--------|-----------|
| Rapid Resource Reallocation | Budget line shifts | % Cap (e.g., 5% total budget) | Assembly audit weekly |
| Temporary Mobility Restrictions | Geozone-specific | Time-limited (7-day renewals) | Rights Chamber review |
| Data Collection Expansion | Defined dataset | Sunset automatic; no secondary use | DDRA + CRC oversight |
| Fast-Track Procurement | Critical goods/services | Transparency ledger required | Independent audit |
| Quorum Adjustments | Virtual deliberation | Only procedural, not rights votes | Public logging |

## 4. Rights Safeguards
- Non-derogable rights remain absolute (life, bodily autonomy, due process, non-discrimination).
- Any rights-limiting measure must include: Justification → Least restrictive means statement → Review timer.
- Automatic expiry: If not re-certified, lapses without renewal vote.

## 5. Temporal Controls
| Phase | Max Duration | Renewal Mechanism |
|-------|--------------|-------------------|
| Initial Activation | 14 days | Simple Assembly majority |
| Extended Phase I | +30 days | Supermajority (e.g., 60%) |
| Extended Phase II | +30 days | Supermajority + Rights Chamber concurrence |
| Beyond 74 Days | Exceptional only | Constitutional Court advisory + public referendum (if feasible) |

## 6. Transparency & Accountability
- Daily situation briefs (Tiered detail: technical + public summary).
- Open Data: Non-sensitive metrics (infection rates, restoration %, resource flows).
- Decision Log: Timestamped rationale for each extraordinary action.

## 7. Oversight Bodies During Emergency
| Body | Focus | Cadence |
|------|-------|---------|
| Executive Council | Operational coordination | Continuous |
| Crisis Review Panel (ad hoc) | Cross-domain expert validation | 72h reports |
| Rights Chamber | Rights impact monitoring | Weekly |
| Council of Generations | Long-horizon distortion watch | Mid-phase assessment |
| CRC | Legal proportionality | As petitioned |

## 8. Deactivation & Recovery
- Formal declaration of cessation with summary of: Actions taken, Rights deviations, Outstanding risks.
- Post-Emergency Audit (within 45 days): Effectiveness, rights impacts, budget variance.
- Sunset of all temporary datasets unless retention justified.

## 9. Abuse Prevention & Red Flags
| Indicator | Concern | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Emergency renewal without new evidence | Power drift | Automatic Rights Chamber escalation |
| Data retention past sunset | Privacy erosion | Mandatory purge order |
| Procurement anomalies | Corruption risk | Forensic audit trigger |
| Participation suppression claims | Democratic erosion | Independent investigation |

## 10. Simulation & Preparedness
- Annual multi-domain stress test (tabletop + technical simulation).
- Public after-action report & capability roadmap.

## 11. Change Management
- Amendments require comparative analysis (prior crises vs. proposed change).
