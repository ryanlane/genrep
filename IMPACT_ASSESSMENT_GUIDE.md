# Impact Assessment Guide (v0.1 Draft)

Standardized frameworks for evaluating proposals across rights, future generations, and cross-cutting systemic risks.

## 1. Rights Impact Assessment (RIA) Template

| Section | Purpose | Key Questions |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Summary | Plain-language overview | What does the proposal do? Who is affected? |
| Scope & Methodology | Transparent process | What data sources? What assumptions? |
| Affected Populations | Identify protected classes | Are impacts disproportionate? |
| Fundamental Rights Analysis | Map to Bill of Protections | Which rights are implicated? |
| Privacy & Data Dignity | Data lifecycle | What data is collected, stored, retained? |
| Accessibility & Inclusion | Universal design | Are there barriers for disability / language? |
| Due Process & Redress | Remedies availability | Are there appeal or correction pathways? |
| Algorithmic / Automated Components | Fairness review | Are systems explainable & auditable? |
| Mitigation Measures | Remediation plan | How will harms be minimized? |
| Residual Risk | Post-mitigation assessment | What unresolved risks remain and why? |
| Monitoring & Metrics | Ongoing evaluation | Which KPIs and reporting cadence? |
| Strict Scrutiny Appendix (if triggered) | Justification | Compelling interest? Narrow tailoring? Least restrictive means? |

### RIA Output Levels (Example)
- Level 0: Minimal (no significant rights impact)
- Level 1: Moderate (mitigations required)
- Level 2: High (strict scrutiny triggered)
- Level 3: Critical (requires redesign or is blocked pending revision)

## 2. Future Impact Assessment (FIA) Template

| Section | Purpose | Key Questions |
|---------|---------|---------------|
| Overview & Horizons | Set temporal scope | Which timeframes (25 / 50 / 100 yrs)? |
| Modeling Inputs | Transparency | What models & datasets are used? |
| Environmental Trajectories | Ecological sustainability | Carbon, biodiversity, resource depletion? |
| Technological Dependencies | Lock-in risk | Does this create brittle reliance? |
| Demographic & Social Projections | Equity over time | Who bears long-term burdens? |
| Economic Sustainability | Intergenerational fiscal balance | Debt, maintenance burdens, productivity shifts? |
| Cultural & Knowledge Preservation | Heritage impacts | Does it erode linguistic/cultural continuity? |
| Risk & Uncertainty Register | Epistemic humility | What are key unknowns & variance ranges? |
| Adaptive Triggers Proposal | Resilience | What metrics should trigger review? |
| Mitigation & Transition Pathways | Harm avoidance | What future-proofing measures apply? |
| Net Intergenerational Equity Analysis | Distribution | Are future cohorts advantaged or burdened? |
| Scenario Matrix | Comparative outcomes | Best case / reference / worst case narratives |
| Residual Long-Horizon Risks | Escalation candidates | What may require veto consideration? |

### FIA Qualitative Rating (Illustrative)
- Net Positive (Sustainability reinforced)
- Mixed (Tradeoffs; mitigations essential)
- Risk-Biased (Benefits uncertain vs. clear long-term risks)
- Catastrophic Risk Candidate (Triggers Generational Veto review)

## 3. Consolidated Dossier Integration
- Merge: Evidence Brief + RIA + FIA → Public Dossier.
- Cross-Check Table: Conflicts or reinforcing findings across assessments.
- Mitigation Matrix: Risk → Mitigation → Owner → Deadline → Monitoring KPI.

---

## 4. Adaptive Triggers Catalog (Starter Examples)
| Domain | Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|--------|-----------|--------|
| Climate | CO₂ intensity | > X trajectory | Trigger policy tightening review |
| Fiscal | Maintenance backlog % | > Y% of annual capital budget | Freeze expansion components |
| Participation | Demographic variance | > Z std dev from mean | Targeted engagement intervention |
| AI System | Bias disparity ratio | > 1.25 baseline | Mandatory algorithmic audit |

---

## 5. Governance & Accountability
- Ownership: Each assessment must list Responsible Officer + Public Contact.
- Versioning: All revisions timestamped with change log.
- Transparency: Machine-readable JSON export for external analysis.

---
## 6. Quality Assurance Checklist
- Independent methodological peer review (Evidence & FIA)
- Conflict of interest declarations logged
- Plain-language summaries validated via readability test (e.g., Flesch target)
- Accessibility conformance (WCAG 2.2 AA minimum)

---
## 7. Future Extensions
- Add Social Impact Ledger linking short-term dashboards to long-horizon projections.
- Integrate probabilistic risk scoring (Monte Carlo ranges) in FIA.
- Standard API schema for civic tech tooling.
