# Civic Credits Charter (v0.1 Draft)

A normative + procedural framework for recognizing sustained, meaningful civic engagement without creating inequitable access to rights or essential services.

## 1. Purpose
- Encourage informed, recurring participation.
- Surface and reward high-quality deliberative contributions.
- Support a culture where engagement is normalized and celebrated.

## 2. Core Principles
1. Non-Coercive: Credits augment recognition; they never gate fundamental rights.
2. Non-Transferable: Credits are tied to a single verified civic identity.
3. Privacy-Preserving: Only aggregate, anonymized engagement stats are public.
4. Quality over Quantity: Weighting favors depth (jury service) over repetitive low-effort actions.
5. Equity Safeguard: Differential access is monitored to prevent systemic bias.

## 3. Earning Credits (Illustrative Weights)
| Activity | Base Credits | Quality Multiplier (Q) | Notes |
|----------|--------------|------------------------|-------|
| Verified Vote | 1 | N/A | One per cycle |
| Completion of Evidence Module | 0.5 | N/A | Capped per proposal |
| Citizen Jury Service | 20 | 0.8–1.2 | Post-service evaluation |
| Rights Chamber Service | 25 | 0.9–1.3 | Higher scrutiny |
| Proposal Authorship (Accepted to Dossier) | 10 | 0.8–1.1 | Spam filter enforced |
| Mitigation Plan Contribution (Adopted) | 6 | 0.9–1.2 | Traceable merge |
| Algorithmic Audit Citizen Panel | 8 | 0.9–1.1 | Specialized training |
| Civic Literacy Certification (Tier) | 5 / 10 / 15 | N/A | Foundational / Advanced / Specialist |

## 4. Recognition & Benefits (Non-Essential Only)
- Public Service Fast-Track Workshops (early registration)
- Transit / library enhancement perks
- Civic innovation micro-grant eligibility
- Open badges & verifiable attestations

Exclusions: No priority in emergency services, legal aid, healthcare, or rights adjudication.

## 5. Anti-Gaming & Integrity
- Rate limits on low-effort actions.
- Random audits of high-volume contributors.
- Anomaly detection (temporal clustering, IP/device anomalies) with due process.

## 6. Lifecycle & Expiration
- Rolling 4-year decay (credits older than 4 years lapse) to encourage current engagement.
- Historical cumulative ledger retained (non-public) for research with privacy controls.

## 7. Equity Monitoring
| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Participation Equity Index | >1.25 variance | Targeted outreach program |
| Jury Representation Gap | >5% under-representation | Adjust stratification weights |
| Credit Accumulation Skew (Top 10% share) | >40% | Rebalance weighting formula |

## 8. Governance
- Administered by an Independent Civic Participation Office.
- Annual public audit + methodology transparency report.
- Open API (read-only) for aggregated anonymized stats.

## 9. Revocation & Appeals
- Revocation only for fraudulent accumulation (due process: notice → response window → determination → appeal body review).
- Innocent data entry/system errors corrected without penalty.

## 10. Change Management
- Modifications require: Public consultation → Impact analysis (equity + participation) → Formal update log.
