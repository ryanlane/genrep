# Glossary (Working Draft)

> Shared definitions to ensure consistency across all pillars and implementation documents.

## Core Governance Layers
- **People's Assembly:** The aggregate decision layer consisting of all eligible citizens participating through authorized voting and deliberation mechanisms. Not a fixed chamber—an emergent procedural layer.
- **Local Assembly:** Open, geographically bounded forum (physical or hybrid) for proposal incubation and grounded deliberation.
- **Citizen Jury:** Randomly selected, stratified mini-public convened for a defined mandate (evaluation, recommendation, rights review). Operates with trained facilitation and publishes a report.
- **Citizen Panel:** Mixed group of randomly selected citizens and domain experts formed to co-interpret specialized evidence (e.g., climate models, bioethics).
- **Scientific Integrity Council (SIC):** Independent peer-elected body that produces/validates Evidence Briefs and issues Scientific Objections.
- **Council of Generations (CoG):** Institution representing long-term interests; reviews Future Impact Assessments (FIAs) and can issue Generational Vetoes.
- **Equal Protection Commission (EPC):** Investigatory body auditing discrimination and systemic rights impacts.
- **Rights Chamber:** A dedicated Citizen Jury variant trained in constitutional and rights principles, validating Rights Impact Assessments (RIAs).

## Artifacts & Assessments
- **Proposal:** A structured submission following the standard template (Problem → Rationale → Policy Instruments → Expected Impacts → References).
- **Endorsement Threshold:** Minimum verified citizen support required to elevate a proposal to formal review (parameterized; default range 2–5% of eligible national electorate or jurisdictional subset).
- **Evidence Brief:** Plain-language synthesis of current consensus, uncertainties, modeled impacts, and risk-benefit analysis authored or validated by SIC.
- **Rights Impact Assessment (RIA):** Systematic analysis of a proposal’s effects on protected classes, fundamental rights, accessibility, privacy, and procedural fairness—includes mitigation plan.
- **Future Impact Assessment (FIA):** Long-horizon (25/50/100 year) scenario modeling of ecological, technological, demographic, cultural, and intergenerational equity impacts.
- **Future Impact Report (FIR):** Consolidated output: FIA + CoG commentary + required mitigations or adaptation triggers.
- **Evidence Score:** Standardized rating (Strong Consensus / Mixed Evidence / Speculative / Contradicts Established Science) with methodology published.
- **Generational Veto:** Blocking action issued by CoG for policies deemed catastrophically harmful over modeled horizons; overridable only via supermajority + referendum.
- **Scientific Objection:** Prominent advisory flag noting factual contradiction or methodological unsoundness; does not itself block progression.
- **Mitigation Plan:** Binding set of adjustments or safeguards required prior to implementation.
- **Adaptive Trigger:** Conditional clause that automatically alters, sunsets, or escalates policy review upon metric threshold crossing.

## Participation & Engagement
- **Civic Credits:** Non-transferable recognition tokens earned for verified participation (voting, jury service, evidence review). Cannot gate fundamental rights or essential services.
- **Civic Literacy Certification:** Voluntary tiered credential demonstrating proficiency in governance processes, enabling eligibility for advanced deliberative roles.
- **Engagement Duty Cycle:** The interval within which a citizen may be called for mandatory deliberative service (target: once per 5–10 years).

## Safeguards & Statuses
- **Cooling-off Period:** Mandatory delay before final vote on proposals affecting fundamental rights or with high volatility indicators.
- **Advisory Objection:** Non-blocking flag (scientific, rights, or generational) requiring prominent public disclosure.
- **Conditional Approval:** Approval contingent upon specified mitigations or monitoring frameworks being in place.
- **Sunset Clause:** Pre-defined expiry or mandatory review date baked into enabling statute.

## Data & Technology
- **Open Model:** Any simulation or AI system whose code, training data provenance (where permissible), assumptions, and evaluation metrics are publicly documented.
- **Algorithmic Impact Assessment (AIA):** Structured review of an automated system’s fairness, explainability, data governance, and potential discriminatory externalities.

## Metrics & Monitoring
- **Core Long-Horizon Indicators (CLHIs):** Curated metric set (e.g., carbon intensity, biodiversity index, debt sustainability, education resilience) tracked across generational intervals.
- **Participation Equity Index:** Composite measuring variance of engagement rates across demographic cohorts.
- **Cultural Continuity Index:** Composite indicator tracking vitality of heritage assets (transmission rates, language program retention, active practice diversity).
- **Creative Participation Rate:** Number of unique citizens engaged in recognized creative/publicly funded cultural production per 1,000 population.
- **Intergenerational Cultural Commons:** Federated repository of publicly funded creative works, heritage archives, and scenario artifacts under open civic licensing.
- **Narrative Scenario Artifact:** A creative output (illustration set, audio drama, immersive simulation, design fiction) appended to policy dossiers to aid public comprehension of modeled futures.

## Standard Escalation Ladder (Conceptual)
Informational Notice → Advisory Objection → Mandatory Mitigation → Conditional Approval → Veto (override pathways defined in governance parameters).
