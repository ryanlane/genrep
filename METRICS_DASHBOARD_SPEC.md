# Metrics Dashboard Specification (v0.1 Draft)

Defines public transparency and monitoring infrastructure for ongoing policy and governance health.

## 1. Objectives
- Provide real-time and longitudinal visibility into governance performance.
- Enable independent analysis via open data APIs.
- Surface early warning indicators (rights risk, participation inequity, future harm trajectories).

## 2. Core Metric Domains
| Domain | Goal | Example Metrics |
|--------|------|-----------------|
| Participation | Broad, equitable engagement | Turnout %, Participation Equity Index, Jury completion rate |
| Rights & Equity | Protect fundamental dignity | Discrimination complaints resolved %, Accessibility compliance %, RIA mitigation completion |
| Scientific Integrity | Evidence alignment | % Policies with Strong Consensus rating, Objection recurrence count |
| Future Stewardship | Long-horizon sustainability | Carbon intensity trajectory alignment %, Generational Veto rate, Adaptive trigger activations |
| Implementation Performance | Delivery fidelity | KPI attainment %, Budget variance %, Mitigation plan compliance |
| Algorithmic Governance | Responsible automation | Audit completion %, Bias threshold breaches, Model transparency coverage |
| Emergency Readiness | Crisis resilience | Time-to-activation drills, Post-exercise remediation closure rate |
| Cultural & Creative Ecosystem | Narrative capacity & heritage continuity | Cultural Continuity Index, Creative Participation Rate, Open Cultural Asset Reuse Rate, Foresight Integration Count |

## 3. Data Architecture
- Source Ingestion: Each institution publishes signed JSON feeds.
- Data Validation: Schema + anomaly detection prior to publication.
- Storage: Append-only event log + aggregated materialized views.

## 4. API (High-Level)
| Endpoint | Purpose | Notes |
|----------|---------|-------|
| /metrics/current | Snapshot of key indicators | Cached (5 min) |
| /metrics/history?metric= | Time-series retrieval | Supports pagination |
| /events/flags | All active objections/flags | Filter by type |
| /policies/{id}/dashboard | Per-policy composite | Includes lifecycle state |
| /participation/demographics | Equity breakdown | Privacy thresholds applied |

## 5. Privacy & Ethics
- Minimum cell suppression for demographic splits (< threshold masked).
- Differential privacy noise for sensitive longitudinal cohorts.
- Public methodology whitepaper versioned.

## 6. Visualization Guidelines
- Color accessibility: WCAG AA contrast.
- Plain-language tooltips for each metric (source, update cadence, interpretation hints).
- Trend emphasis over raw absolute numbers (contextual baselines).

## 7. Early Warning Indicators (Illustrative)
| Indicator | Trigger | Response |
|-----------|---------|----------|
| Participation Equity Index > threshold 2 cycles | Sustained under-representation | Launch targeted outreach program |
| Rights Mitigation Overdue > 10% | Compliance erosion | CRC notice escalation |
| Generational Veto Frequency Spike | Policy short-termism trend | Convene foresight forum |
| Bias Breaches Tier ≥3 > 2 in quarter | Algorithmic governance slippage | External audit expansion |
| Cultural Continuity Index decline > threshold over 2 periods | Heritage erosion | Trigger targeted preservation grants |
| Creative Participation Rate < equity minimum | Participation inequity | Deploy outreach + microgrant wave |
| Protected Motif Consent Compliance < 98% | Ethical usage risk | Initiate compliance review & education cycle |

## 8. Governance & Stewardship
- Metrics Steward Group (multi-institution) meets monthly.
- Quarterly Public Metrics Forum for citizen questions & feedback.
- Annual recalibration cycle (add/remove metrics with public RFC).

## 9. Integrity & Anti-Manipulation
- Cryptographic signing of all published datasets.
- Public hash ledger for tamper detection.
- Independent civic tech replication challenges (bug bounty analog).

## 10. Roadmap (Planned Enhancements)
- Streaming websocket channel for near-real-time flag events.
- Machine-readable policy dependency graph.
- Predictive risk scoring (experimental, transparency-first).
